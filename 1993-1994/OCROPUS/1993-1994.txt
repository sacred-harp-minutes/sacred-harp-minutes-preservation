we are dust. As for man, his days are as grass: as s flower of the field,
so he flourisheth. For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone, and the place
thereof shall know it no more. But the mercy of the Lord is from
everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness
unto childrenns childrren.' Amanda Denson then made remarks summarized
as follows: ' When l was twelve years old, Uncle Pain Denson, Aunt Ruthy
(Ruth Denson Edwards), Aunt Annie (Ann Denson Asron ) snd l went to the
Chattahoochee Convention in 6eorgia. The cream of the crop were there,
and we had a glorious tine, but when we got home l said, 'Aunty Ruthy, it
takes so long when we sing for those dead people.' She replied, ' Amanda,
you will grow to love this part best, ' and I heve. It has become my
favorite part of the singing. All of those people sang for others all their
lNes, and now we are singinq for them, and some day our children will sing
for all of us. The cycle goes on and on. We are only a link in a chain -- a
q0lden chain. It makes me happy to sing today with members of the
Godsey, Lacy, Creel, Nic6raw and Beasley families, my own family , and
other families long associaled with Sacred Herp. However, those who have
gone on before us can outclass any voice in this room. Its not death--
period, but death-comma.
' You do nol make any thing the foundation of your life that can be laken
away from you. The people we remember today knew that, and Sacred
Herp was a large part of many of their lives. This is part of the reason for
a Sacred Herp heart. If you have never heard that term before, it means
goodness and kindness personified. lt is what makes us like an exiended
femily, and it is what makes us endure from generation to qeneration. Hens
Christian Andersen said, ' Every mans life is a fairy tale wrilten by &ods
fingers. ' We sre all srtisis. We are each painting a picture-- a picture of
life' In closing. Amanda Denson said, 'lt is Palm Sunday and for all
friends, loved ones, and Sacred Harp singers of all time who already have
the resurrecled life, lets sing Easter Anthem.' Then Hugh hlc 6raw and
Amanda Denson led 236. Pat Hiqard read the names of the sick and

lemorisl Committee. fleg Parsons began with these thoughts: This is s
very special singing, and this is a very special weekend. This is lemorial
Day weekend, snd l think its appropriate that on this day we remember the
members of our extended comrmunity- people who have died in the pssl
year, or who sre sick and not able to be with us. When we read their
names, each of them holds a special meaning to each of us, because they
Bre 8 p8rt of our community. As we read their narmes, and as we sing the
songs, we'd liko to rofloct on what thoso words rnoan- What tho songs
mean to us 8S 8 COInmunity. In addition, as we sing the songs, 3S we do all
the time, l think, we remember people who are special to us, peopla who
have been influentisl in our lives- grandparents, parents, brothers,
sislers, spouses- whove gone on before us. On this flemorial Day
weekend, we think its also appropriate that we remember people whose
names we don't know, people who have died in wars, men and wormen
whove given us the freedom to be here today, also people from around the
world who are now suffering in war and famine; People here in our
community, who are alone, afraid, sick, hungry. For those of us whove
either been born to the tradition of Sacred Harp, or who have found it
recently in their lives, we are very fortunate. We are a community. If we
are not together by location, as we are today, as we sing the songs at
home we think of each other. We comfort each other by singing our song5,
as we think of each other, and as we think of God. Helen Bryson then read
the names of the deceased: Virgina, Hilda delRe; flichigsn, Jarmes Windom
Sr,, Kirk Norton, Fred Buesser. Florida, Jane Rend. Alabama. Leonard
lLacy, lera Tolleson, rirs. Odell Cleveland, dN. Busby and G. Grant.

spoke briefly before his lesson 'lts an honor for me to be here. This is a
sad time; a lot of these people, if you just think of it, theres a whole
congregation of these people that she called that have passed away. l don't
know a lot ot them, mostley the ones from Alabama. Tlost sll of you know
lLeonard Lacy; lve known him as long as lve known anybody. He will be
missed; He was a very useful man. At my fether and mother's funeral,
when they passed away, he was the leader of the singing, and thought it
was the prettest singing that l ever heard. Anyway, we miss then all.' He

With time for one leader before dinner, 3uell Cobb (AlL) was called,
who prefaced his lesson on page 349, with the following: '!'d like to
preach instead of sing. l know that one of the many sppeals of Sacred Harp
Singing is that we spend more of our time singing then presching, but I
do want to just ssy this one thing, snd that is that for those of us
from the traditional areas that have been singing Sacred Harp before, lhe
Chicaqo Community seems like the gateway to the undiscovered territory.
This is not only the largest and the most vigorous of all the communities
that have taken up Sacred Harp recently, but it has also done a wonderful
job in shepherding other and smaller groups, and so for that, for the old
singers and the new singers everywhere, 1 salute you and thank you for

then delivered the following memorisl moments. Prayer 'O might cloud of
witnesses, open our eyes to behold, our ears to hear, our minds to recieve.
Armen, As we remermber, let us be aware that these have passed into that
life that is life indeed. Their lives serve as memorisls to them. Now a cloud
of witnesses as 8 royal and very real presence, encormpassing us in such s
way as to afford real peace and comfort in times of distress and despsir.
Entering into our deepest j0ys, and enriching each worship experience-
lending to each a new dimesnion. It has been my experience that, in times
of need, my loved ones are closer in the spiritual realm than they were in
the physical- 0f the righteous dead the Bible speakes: their works do
follow them. We speak of then as dead, but, is anyone really dead who has
lived a good lifs'?
Theodore Roosevelt, while mourning the untimely death of a young s0n,
concluded, Both life and death are s part of the same grest advanture. When
we become Christians, we become resurrection people. A part of the body
of the resurrected Christ. We are told that we become the righteousnes9
of 6od through Christ. The resurrection of Christ is the most important
129
event the world has ever known. It is not just the hope, the assurance of
our own physical ressurrection. But, for the Christisns, the important
thing is not that there will be this resurrection, but that we ss Christisns,
rsised with Christ, can, and should, lesd a resurrectsd life right here,
riht nowl The very thought should bring us to our knees, then lift us up to
joyful prsise.

lLesders: 1. V. Cockrell, 192, 269. A memorial lesson was held at this time.
l ask that each one here this morning have a prayer in your heart for me
and this memorial service. 1 feel priviledged to be here today with loving
and caring christian people, and to offer prayers for comfort to familes
and friends of those who have gone on before us. The following have gone
on a journey since we sang here a year ago. 6od grant that we may meet
together in the world above where troubles will cease and harmony will
8bound. l want you to remember some thing about each one whose nsme l
will call, The heartache and loneliness are here with us, but there is a
peace in knowing there is no more pain and suffering, aIS0 imagine we hear
the voice of the ones who proceded us. Do not stand by my grave and weep,
l em not there, I do not sleep , l am a thousand winds that blow, l am a
diamond glint on snow, l am the sunlight on ripened grain, l am the genlle
autunm rain, when you awake in the morning, hush l am the swift uplifting
rush of quiet birds in circling flight, I am the soft starshine at night. Do nol
stsnd by my grave and cry l am not there. I did not die.
by saying these words my memory of each one gone on is not at the
grave yard, but in the notes that have been sung, the birds, breezes,
prayers and jusl evey day living brings them to mind each day of the year.
l would like to say one thing about Sacred Harp, precious memories flood
rmy soul and cause me to be proud of a herilage that continues to bless my
life, Fsce may dirm as years come and go, but stopping again in the tracks
that have been made in the past is good medicine for the soul. Now for
Ephisisnas 5 :19 'Speak to one another with Psalms , Hymns and spiritusl
songs- sing and made music in your heart to the Lord always giving thanks
to 6od the Father for every thing in the nsme of our Lord desus Christ'. l
feel that each one who has preceded us will be singing wilh us in much
brighter tones than we can deliver on this earth. Edith Tete will led song
147
on page 46 for the following decesse: Preston Crider, Henry Johnson, Billy
6albreath, Belle Venie Woodard, Rosa tcCoy, 5ennie Keeton, Arthur Ward,
lLeonard Lacy, Noah Lscy, E. C. Bowen, John Barfield, Curtis hlclendon,
Priscilla Childers, Olmer Shipp, Arthur Calvert snd Louie Battle. For the
sick and shut-ins we ask that our creator and our eternal 6od put his
lovIng arms around those who are unable to be with us because of sickness.
6od cares about our sorrows and sickness and has promised to give
gidnance snd comfort if we will but trust him. flay the warmth of knowing
&od flow over them and ease their pain and suffering. Let us ask ourselves
whet he would heve us do for the sick and disable, maybe send cards, have
a prayer on our lips or make a short phone call to some one. All would like
akind word to express our care and build their hope and don't forget to say
I love you. Lislen to the word as we sing florning Prayer led by Velton
Chafin for the following tlavis and Leon Price, Flora Otwell, Lucile
