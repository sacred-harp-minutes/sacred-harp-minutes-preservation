lLesders: 1. V. Cockrell, 192, 269. A memorial lesson was held at this time.
l ask that each one here this morning have a prayer in your heart for me
and this memorial service. 1 feel priviledged to be here today with loving
and caring christian people, and to offer prayers for comfort to familes
and friends of those who have gone on before us. The following have gone
on a journey since we sang here a year ago. 6od grant that we may meet
together in the world above where troubles will cease and harmony will
8bound. l want you to remember some thing about each one whose nsme l
will call, The heartache and loneliness are here with us, but there is a
peace in knowing there is no more pain and suffering, aIS0 imagine we hear
the voice of the ones who proceded us. Do not stand by my grave and weep,
l em not there, I do not sleep , l am a thousand winds that blow, l am a
diamond glint on snow, l am the sunlight on ripened grain, l am the genlle
autunm rain, when you awake in the morning, hush l am the swift uplifting
rush of quiet birds in circling flight, I am the soft starshine at night. Do nol
stsnd by my grave and cry l am not there. I did not die.
by saying these words my memory of each one gone on is not at the
grave yard, but in the notes that have been sung, the birds, breezes,
prayers and jusl evey day living brings them to mind each day of the year.
l would like to say one thing about Sacred Harp, precious memories flood
rmy soul and cause me to be proud of a herilage that continues to bless my
life, Fsce may dirm as years come and go, but stopping again in the tracks
that have been made in the past is good medicine for the soul. Now for
Ephisisnas 5 :19 'Speak to one another with Psalms , Hymns and spiritusl
songs- sing and made music in your heart to the Lord always giving thanks
to 6od the Father for every thing in the nsme of our Lord desus Christ'. l
feel that each one who has preceded us will be singing wilh us in much
brighter tones than we can deliver on this earth. Edith Tete will led song
