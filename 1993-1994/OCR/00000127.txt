Richard Whatley expressed thanks to the Wilson Family and all others who
made the convention a success. Our resolution is one of thanksgiving and
praise. Thanks to a loving and gracious God who has sustained us. that we
might gather together in this holy place for one more meeting. Praise
because our meager songs fall far short of the true glory to which He is
entitled.
We especially wish to thank the Wilson family, without whose help and
generosity this convention could not have been held. Words can not express
the gratitude of everyone gathered here for their tireless efforts on behalf
of this convention. We would also like to recognize and thank the members
of the various organizing committees for their hard work, the ones who
prepared and brought the meals, and all the ones who came to lift their
voices in praise. May the Lord bless and keep you all till we meet again.
