event the world has ever known. It is not just the hope, the assurance of
our own physical ressurrection. But, for the Christians, the important
thing is not that there will be this resurrection, but that we as Christians,
raised with Christ, can, and should, lead a resurrected life right here,
right now! The very thought should bring us to our knees, then lift us up to
joyful praise.
