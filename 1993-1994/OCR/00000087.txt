names, each of them holds a special meaning to each of us. because they
are a part of our community. As we read th8ir names, and as W8 sing the
songs, we'd like to reflect on what those words mean- What the songs
mean to us as a community. In addition, as we sing the songs, as we do all
the time, I think, we remember people who are special to us, people who
have been influential in our lives- grandparents, parents, brothers,
sisters, spouses- who've gone on before us. On this Memorial Day
weekend, we think it's also appropriate that we remember people whose
names we don't know, people who have died in wars, men and women
who've given us the freedom to be here today; also people from around the
world who are now suffering in war and famine; People here in our
community, who are alone, afraid, sick, hungry. For those of us who've
either been born to the tradition of Sacred Harp, or who have found it
recently in their lives, we are very fortunate. We are a community. If we
are not together by location, as we are today, as we sing the songs at
home we think of each other. We comfort each other by singing our songs,
as we think of each other, and as we think of God. Helen Bryson then read

spoke briefly before his lesson "It's an honor for me to be here. This is a
sad time; a lot of these people, if you just think of it. there's a whole
congregation of these people that she called that have passed away. I don't
know a lot ot them, mostley the ones from Alabama. Most all of you know
Leonard Lacy; I've known him as long as IVe known anybody. He will be
missed; He was a very useful man. At my father and mother's funeral,

With time for one leader before dinner, Buell Cobb (AL) was called,
who prefaced his lesson on page 349, with the following: Td like to
preach instead of sing. I know that one of the many appeals of Sacred Harp
Singing is that we spend more of our time singing then preaching, but I
do want to just say this one thing, and that is that for those of us
