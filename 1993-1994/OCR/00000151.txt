sick and shut-ins we ask that our creator and our eternal God put his
loving arms around those who are unable to be with us because of sickness.
6od cares about our sorrows and sickness and has promised to give
guidnance and comfort if we will but trust him. May the warmth of knowing
God flow over them and ease their pain and suffering. Let us ask ourselves
what he would have us do for the sick and disable, maybe send cards, have
a prayer on our lips or make a short phone call to some one. All would like
a kind word to express our care and build their hope and don't forget to say
I love you. Listen to the word as we sing Morning Prayer led by Velton
