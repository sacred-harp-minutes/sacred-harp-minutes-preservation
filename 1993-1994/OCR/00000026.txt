FOUR-NOTE SINGING
Marion, Kentucky
January 23, 1993
The annual Four Note Singing was called to order at 9:30 a.m. by
William Paris. He introduced Judge Jon May who welcomed singers to
Marion. Mr. Paris announced that both morning and afternoon session would
consist of about one hour's singing from each of two books, The Southern
Harmony and The Sacred Harp. Tim Reynolds distibuted a list of 150 songs
that are in both books. The chairman called the fist hour of singing to order
by demonstrating the pendulum for keeping time, as explained in the
introduction to The Southern Harmony. Knots in the string cause the
pendulun to sway at different speeds, setting the time for 2/4, 4/4. 6/8
and so on. Any disagreement about the tempo of a song could be settled by
the pendulum.

Harmony, dedicating it to Pleasant Hill Church, which revised shape note
