Ella Wilcox, who turned the floor over to Amanda Denson. Howard Brady
read Psalm 103: 14-17 "For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that
we are dust. As for man. his days are as grass*, as a flower of the field,
so he flourisheth. For the wind passeth over it. and it is gone; and the place
thereof shall know it no more. But the mercy of the Lord is from
everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him. and his righteousness
unto children's children." Amanda Denson then made remarks summarized
as follows:" When 1 was twelve years old. Uncle Pain Denson. Aunt Ruthy
(Ruth Denson Edwards), Aunt Annie (Ann Denson Aaron ) and I went to the
Chattahoochee Convention in Georgia. The cream of the crop were there,
and we had a glorious time, but when we got home I said, "Aunty Ruthy, it
takes so long when we sing for those dead people." She replied." Amanda,
you will grow to love this part best, " and I have. It has become my
favorite part of the singing. All of those people sang for others all their
lives, and now we are singing for them, and some day our children will sing
for all of us. The cycle goes on 2nd on. We are only a link in a chain — a
golden chain. It makes me happy to sing today with members of the
Godsey, Lacy, Creel. McGraw and Beasley families, my own family , and
other families long associated with Sacred Harp. However, those who have
gone on before us can outclass any voice in this room. It's not death-
period, but death--comma.
" You do not make any thing the foundation of your life that cat be taken
away from you. The people we remember today knew that, and Sacred
Harp was a large part of many of their lives. This is part of the reason for
a Sacred Harp heart. If you have never heard that term before, it means
goodness and kindness personified. It is what makes us like an extended
family, and it is what makes us endure from generation to generation. Hans
Christian Andersen said," Every man's life is a fairy tale written by God's
fingers." We are all artists. We are each painting a picture— a picture of
life." In closing. Amanda Denson said, "It is Palm Swiday and for all
friends, loved ones, and Sacred Harp singers of all time who already have
the resurrected life, let's sing Easter Anthem." Then Hugh Mc Graw and
Amanda Denson led 236. Pat Higard read the names of the sick and
shut-ins: W. Smith (MD); Pansy McCormell (NM). John and Catherine
DeNys (IL), George and Pat Lippi (Wl), Mother and Father Rudolph (ND)
