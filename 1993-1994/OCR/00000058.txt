thanks to Steve Sabol fop his tireless activity on behalf of Sacred Harp
Singing, locating Hearst Hall, publicity and finance, and Tor his gracious
generosity and hospitality to singers from near and far at his home last
night. We thank Reuben Musgrave for inviting singers to sing at the
Cathedral this morning and share our music. We want to thank Bill Windom
for recording the convention. Lastly, we wish to thank the Memorial
Committee for one of the most eloquent and moving memorial lessons I've
known. They pretty well expressed my deepest fellings about the power
and joy Sacred Harp singing has on our lives. This the fourth Potomac
River Convention. We are still in our infancy, but I can see us maturing,
deepening and developing what Amanda has called a "Sacred Harp heart".
We thank all the singers here and those afar who have nurtured us along the
way. It is the coimtless acts of kindness, individual generosity aid
welcoming love that have contributed to a near perfect world these two
and a half days. Dee Peterman;s daughter Molly was given special
