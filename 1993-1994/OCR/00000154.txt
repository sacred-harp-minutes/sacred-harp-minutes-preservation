preceded us and gone on to the beautiful throne described by John in
Revelation 4:3 and there was a rainbow round about the throne. We can't
even imagin how beautiful heaven must be, but thank about the rainbow. It
is so beautiful, but we here on earth have seen only half a rainbow. The
ones whose names will be read are now enjoying the full rainbow around
the throne. We can be thankful for the heritage they have left us that
continues to bless our lives. A few years ago I really didn't know they sang
Sacred Harp except when we had homecoming at the church I grew up in. I
thouht they came because they liked us. But I've found more fulminant in
my life since I've learned these praises are sung for and near, and I want
to thank each one of you for your personal interest in my learning to sing
Sacred Harp. May I just single out one of our deceased. Preston Crider. He
was so good to lead me into and out of the songs which I tried to learn,
bless his soul, he was called to see the great white throne with a beautiful
rainbow around it. He death seem untimely to me. as I am sure he went so
suddenly. Life is so short we are here then gone like the beautiful snow
flakes they seldom fall here in the south, and like our lives, just disappear
so soon, they are like precious stones that we can hold a while, and then
they are gone. As I read the names, fix in your mind all the good things
you can remember about each one. and pray that as we are here we can
show kindness and love that someone cares remember about us as life goes
on. The decease are Leonard Lacy, Noah Lacy, Preston Crider; Arthur
