To Sacred Harp Singers and Friends:
A new year is here, new minutes are out for your use for 1994. The
address of some new singers have been add, the deceased deleted. I know
some addresses are incorrect, but you failed to send the new ones to me. If
you have a change of address please sent it to me by August 1.
I cannot print poems that are used in the memorial lesson because of
copyright. Please write your own memorial lesson so it can be printed.
We had five singing discounted this year, which makes a total of 76 singing
discountinued in the last ten years.
Lets encourge other people young and older to learn the Sacred Harp
Music. We have lost so many of our older singers, we are seeing our
classes become very small in most areas now. In order for the Sacred Harp
singing to grow we must have more people learn to singing this music.
Some of our singers now seen to thank it is a place to go for fun, are see
who can singing the fastest. This should not be the case, our forfather
went and our older singers go now to sing praises to our Lord. Look at the
Bible reference under the names of the song, see where the words of the
song are from. These older writter of Sacred Harp Music wrote the songs
of praise to be sung in reverence to our Lord. Lets carry the singing own
as our forfather did. If we singing so fast our vistors do not understand
the words or notes. I have had several people making this statement" We
can't unders stand what is being sung".
We still have some secretary who do not send the minutes in on time.
Please get your minutes to me on time so they may be in order. All 1993
December singing will be printed in front of 1994 minute. This must be
done if you receive your minutes in February. Continue to send $25.00 per
day and $12.50 for night singing. Make your checks to Sacred Harp
Singings.
Hope each of you have a good year in 1994.
Nora Parker, Secretary
