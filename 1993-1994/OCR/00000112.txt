A lot of blood was shed by our service men in order for us to be here to
day. We have a lot to be proud of and there's a lot wrong in our county, but
when we have people who meet together and sing His praises, we are doing
something right. We have so many opportunities living in these United
States and if he could have his choice of where to go, or what to do. He
would rather be here to day than any place. In his closing remarks
