pause to remember our loved ones, singers and non-singers, that have
passed from our circle. So many familes that were raised in this
community have members of the families here today. Marcia Johnson spoke
of the deceased and of the many sick and shut-ins. She also told of many
nights, when unable to sleep, she would think of so many different things
that are happening in the. U.S. and other countries. However, regardless of
our many cares and trouble, she remembered Leonard Lacy's words, "When
we all sing, all of our cares and troubles just seem to fade away and we
can just forget them for awhile". How lucky we are that we can all do
what we all love to do. and our troubles just kindly pass away and we are
at such perfect peace. She spoke of the words in the song by Jlidy Hauff
that says. Where is the man that draws his breath, sate from disease and
secure from death" and of the words of Ted Mercer song that says" Who
brings salvation on Lheir Longues and words of peace reveal". Shelbie
Sheppard led song on page 290. The memorial was dosed with prayer by
Rev. Clarence Gates. II was voted to do some work on the church. A
collection was taken to help with repairs, since it was voted to keep the
singing here instead of moving it some where else. Leaders,: B. Mâ€ž Smith
