Dear Sacred Harp Singers:
2520 Reld Road N.E.
Birmingham, Alabama 35215
January 1, 1990
lhope the year 1989 was a good year for you, and the new year will
be even better for each of us.
lcannot attend the singings because of Walter's health. l have to be at
home to care for him. Someone has to be with him all of the time. He has
Alzheimer's Disease, and as you know this is an incurable progressive
disease. Also, my mother is sick, and l am the only child, so l must see
that she is cared for too.
lmiss each of you and the Sacred Harp music. l do appreciate your
prayers and cards. It helps to know you have good friends in times of
sickness and trouble. Continue to remember me in your prayer for it is a
very trying time for me.
lLet's speak to one another with Psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.
Sing and make music in our hearts to the Lord. Always give thanks to God,
the father, for everything, in the name of our Lord. Submit to one another
out of reverence for Christ. (Ephesians 5:19-21).
We are losing ground each year. This year we had 10 additional
singings discontinued. ln the last year, we have lost a total of 50 annual
singlngs. Some of this is due to death or sickness of our Sacred Harp
singers.
Continue to send $25.00 per day ($26.50 for Georgia) for the printing
of the minutes for 1990. Please send the minutes in the next week after
the singing is held. If you will do this, your singing will be in the proper
place.
lLet's go this year to all the singings we can and try to get someone
who has never heard this music to go with us. They may wonder how
they've gone this long without it!
Sincerely,
Nora Parker, Secretary
1990 DIRECTORY

RECESS.
The class was reassembled by Jeff Sheppard leading song on page 46.
Marcia Johnson and Emily Collins, 76b. A memorial lesson was held at this
time. The following composition by Kathlen Kuiper of Chicago, reflecting on
the traditon of the memorial lesson , was read to the class by B. M. Smith.
The memorial lesson is a long-standing tradition in Sacred Harp Singlng.
No matter how enthusiastic the singing has been in the earlier part of the
day, traditional singers always take time to remember the singers,
friends, and loved ones who have died in the past year.
For many of us who are just getting our feet wet in the Sacred Harp
tradition, or even singing this music for the first time, the memorial lesson
is an uncomfortable part of a singing. Those who have been singing longer
consider it essential. In his recentley reprinted book The Sacred Harp,
Buell Cobb includes a listener's account of a simple and powerful memorial
lesson led by Mrs. Ruth Denson Edwards. She said (in part) 'When l was a
little girl, 1 didn't like the memorial lesson. 1 thought it was sad, and 1
wanted to get out of the church. But by Daddy said to me, 'Babe'', there
will come a time when you'll think that's the sweetest lesson of all,' And
that time (she said) has come.'
For the Southerners among us the memorial lesson is sweet, because
it's a time to remember and honor the singers who have shared their love
of this music with us for many years; whose leading style or teaching
method has inspired or encouraged us; whose drell or sweet personality has
brought something special to singing-strong singers, singers who have
become legends in the history of Sacred Harp, faithful, kind, and generous
people whose absence will be deeply felt. Even some of us who haven't been
singing very long, have met and sung with some of the legendary Southern
singers ( such as the late Mack Wootten of Sand Mountain and the late D.T.
White), and we see the necessity of recalling them and their gifts to us.
lt's hard sometimes to think about death in such a personal way, because
it seems to mean only our loss. But, as Mrs. Edwards pointed out in her
memorial lesson, 'for all forms of life - there's a cycle.,, We're only born
to die. We go throught four stages. After we're born, we grow, we bear
fruit, we age, and then we die.' We must keep in mind, too, that for some
of our fellow singers who have died, death was a blessed release - we slng
of it in many of our songs. ''m fettered and chained up in clay - I struggle
and pant to be free, 1 long to be soaring away'. We sing 'Death is the gate
to endless joy, 'We sing of sweet fiends arrayed in endless green and
rivers of delight,' of a place 'Where trouble shall cease and harmony shall
abound.' Our pain at the loss of friends and family we loved, of those people
who have enriched our lives must be no more real than our gratitude at
having known then at least as long as we had then with us; our grief must
be no more real than our conviction that we'll sing with them again in that
eternal day. Leaders were called for the memorial as follows: Jerry
Schreiber led 48 for Leon Smith , California; Kris Richardson led 61 and 45
for the Northern deceased: Betty Fennev,Chicago, Thomas Benett Freeman,

Adams, John Chessler and D. T. White Alabama. Daniel Hudson ,Georgia.
Tommy Spurlock spoke about the suddent recent illnesses of Lurleen Heath
and Runie Glover and told the class, ' we're only here for a short time...
Don't ever get too busy that you can't take time to check on the sick and
shut-ins.' He then led song 565 for the following: Leone Diederich, Runie
Glover, Don Conners, Lurleen Heath, Leslie Cates, Jap Walton and Sheila
Wootten. Ruth White then closed the memorial with a prayer. Mary Rose
O'Leary then led song on page 411.

south, but after today she won't say that anymore. The class went into a
business session. Resolution Committee report: Buell Cobb thanked the
convention for the food and the generous hospitality. Marcia Johnson
recalled the first convention in Paxton ll. and reaffirmed the resolution of
that convention to continue to reach out to other singers across the
Midwest and the nation so the family of singers is spread across the counly
like jewels on a necklace. The convention expressed its gratitude to Katy
Early and the University of Chicago Folk-lore Society for co-hosting the
Sunday session. The Finance Committee represented by Wendy Wahn
reported it had covered the expenses. The convention then heard and
approved the locating committee's report. Ted Mercer reported that there
was a date conflict for 1990 and made a motion to change the date of the
Midwest convention from the 2nd fifth Sunday of the year and the Satuday
before to the fifth Sunday of the year immediately preceding the fourth of

FIFTH SUNDAY SINGING
Fifth Sunday was a Special Day
Mongst folks l used to know;
Twas on that day we'd gather and
On God our praise bestow.
For text we used the Sacred Harp,
An oblong book of fame
Containing only four shaped notes,
Fa, sol, la, mi by name.
The leader struck his tuning fork
And pitched the first full chord;
We caught the tone for our own part
And forthwith praised the Lord.
In harmony that swelled the room
And made the rafters ringl
With reverent souls and happy hearts
We did Hosanna sing!

people live. Most days are bright happy shinning sunsets, that are beautiful,
colorful, soothing at the end of the day. Some days clouds cover the sun and
it remains hidden all day. Days are dark, sad, sometimes frightening. The
sunset is still there but it remains unseen - object sinking into an unknown
darkness. Fridnds and relatives who have died since last's year's singlng
have reached the sunset in their lives. But, we never lose the ones we love
for ever though there gone within, in the hearts of those who care, their
memory lingers on. Those we hold most dear never truly leave us. They
live on in the kindness they showed, the singlngs we shared and the
pleasures they brought into our lives.
In our hearts today there is a song a song to help us. Remember the
following people who have died in 1989. Tenor please sing 507, 'Glory of
the Cross'softly while everyone hums. For Floirida, Aubrey Barfield led
