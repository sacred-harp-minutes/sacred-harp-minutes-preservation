of committees. Resolution Committee report: Sacred Harp singers are, for
the most part, easy to please. Give them a little room somewhere, a few
hard benches, and a bite to eat, and they can sing all day long. But when a
facility such as Burritt Museum opens it doors for us, on a beautiful
mountain top, and a community such as Huntsville provides so generously
for our needs, we are reminded of the great loving care and labor involved
in conducting a successful convention. To all who had a part in these
efforts, to all singers and listeners from far and near, the members of the
86th session of The United Sacred Harp Musical Convention hereby express
their deepest gratidude and effection. Respectfully submitted, Jim Carnes
and Buell Cobb, The locating committee reported the 1990 session would
met in Chicago, Illinois. The Finance report was given by Mae Seymour.
