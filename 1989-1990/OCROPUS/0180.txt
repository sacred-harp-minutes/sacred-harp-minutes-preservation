McWhorter, 361. This brings us to the Memorial lesson with Chairperson,
Ruth Brown, 'Paintings of Sunsets'', Beautiful Sunsets represent lives
people live. Most days are bright happy shinning sunsets, that are beautiful,
colorful, soothing at the end of the day. Some days clouds cover the sun and
it remains hidden all day. Days are dark, sad, sometimes frightening. The
sunset is still there but it remains unseen - object sinking into an unknown
darkness. Fridnds and relatives who have died since last's year's singlng
have reached the sunset in their lives. But, we never lose the ones we love
for ever though there gone within, in the hearts of those who care, their
memory lingers on. Those we hold most dear never truly leave us. They
live on in the kindness they showed, the singlngs we shared and the
pleasures they brought into our lives.
In our hearts today there is a song a song to help us. Remember the
following people who have died in 1989. Tenor please sing 507, 'Glory of
