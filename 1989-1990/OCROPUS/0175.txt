read from Psalms 116: 1-9. Love the Lord, because he hath heard my voice
and my supplications. Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore
will l call upon him as long as 1 live. The sorrows of death compassed me,
and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: 1 found trouble and sorrow. Then
called l Upon the name of the Lord; O Lord, l beseech thee, deliver my soul.
Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful. The Lord
preserveth the simple: l was brought low, and he helped me. Return to the
rest, O my soul; for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee. For thou hast
delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears and my feet from
falling. I will walk before the Lord in land of the living. Names of the
