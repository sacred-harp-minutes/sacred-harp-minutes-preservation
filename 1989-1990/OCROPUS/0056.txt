business session. Resolution Committee report: Buell Cobb thanked the
convention for the food and the generous hospitality. Marcia Johnson
recalled the first convention in Paxton ll. and reaffirmed the resolution of
that convention to continue to reach out to other singers across the

reported it had covered the expenses. The convention then heard and
approved the locating committee's report. Ted Mercer reported that there
