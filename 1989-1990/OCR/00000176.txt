allowing us to again assemble for the Alabama State Convention. We thank
the officers and committee members for accepting their tasks prayfully

preparing the delicious meals. The people of the community and members of
the church are to congratulated for their hard work preparing for the
convention. We thank them for the hospitality. We again refect on those who
sang with us and have gone from our midst leaving us with wonderful
memories. We are grateful for having known them and the rich traditon
they shared with us. We thank those who traveled from far and near to
make this a wonderful singing. We pray each will receive a special blessing
from having come. We pray as we enter this holiday season that we do so in
the spirit of love and that we would be protected so that we might join
together in 1990 for another Alabama State Convention. Pennie Morrison
