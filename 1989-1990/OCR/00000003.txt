Dear Sacred Harp Singers:
I hope the year 1989 was a good year for you, and the new year will
be even better for each of us.
I cannot attend the singings because of Walter's health. I have to be at
home to care for him. Someone has to be with him all of the time. He has
Alzheimer's Disease, and as you know this is an incurable progressive
disease. Also, my mother is sick, and I am the only child, so I must see
that she is cared for too.
I miss each of you and the Sacred Harp music. I do appreciate your
prayers and cards. It helps to know you have good friends in times of
sickness and trouble. Continue to remember me in your prayer for it is a
very trying time for me.
Let's speak to one another with Psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.
Sing and make music in our hearts to the Lord. Always give thanks to God,
the father, for everything, in the name of our Lord. Submit to one another
out of reverence for Christ. (Ephesians 5:19-21).
We are losing ground each year. This year we had 10 additional
singings discontinued. In the last year, we have lost a total of 50 annual
singings. Some of this is due to death or sickness of our Sacred Harp
singers.
Continue to send $25.00 per day ($26.50 for Georgia) for the printing
of the minutes for 1990. Please send the minutes in the next week after
the singing is held. If you will do this, your singing will be in the proper
place.
Let's go this year to all the singings we can and try to get someone
who has never heard this music to go with us. They may wonder how
they've gone this long without it!
Sincerely,
Nora Parker, Secretary
