Twas on that day we'd gather and
On God our praise bestow.
For text we used the Sacred Harp,
An oblong book of fame
Containing only four shaped notes,
Fa, sol, la, mi by name.
The leader struck his tuning fork
And pitched the first full chord;
We caught the tone for our own part
And forthwith praised the Lord.
In harmony that swelled the room
And made the rafters ring!
With reverent souls and happy hearts
We did Hosanna sing!
